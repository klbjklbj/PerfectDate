# Pefect Date App
Use this app to find restaurants and events that will take your and your date preferences and return matching and other options. 

## How it works
This app utilizes Eventbrite API to find events and Google Places API to find restaurants. The database is set up in Firebase allowing two users interact with the app within their own sessions. The app uses EmailJS to send an email invite to the second person prompting to complete a form with their preferences. 

Currently app is using place and event ids to check for matches. In future this logic will be improved by adding more sophisticated query.
